Immunofixation-quantitative Serum

Kappa And Lambda-Freelite Serum (Serum)

Free Kappa (Light Chain)(Nephelometry), Observed: 69.20 mg/L(High )
Normal: 3.3-19.4

Free Lambda (Light Chain)(Nephelometry), Observed: 38.00 mg/L(High)
Normal: 5.71-26.3

Free Kappa/ Lambda Ratio, Observed: 1.82(High) 
Normal: 0.26-1.65
(In cases with renal impairment
suggested reference interval
0.37 to 3.1)

Interpretation:

1. Increased production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or free monoclonal light chains leads to a change in the k/lambda light
chain quotient. A k/lambda quotient outside the reference interval is thus an indication of the existence of a monoclonal
gammopathy.
2. Serum light chains are also dependent upon several factors like the type of clonality, presence of associated renal failure or
polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia and thedegree of bone marrow Impairment from the growing tumour or from drug therapy. These factors should be considered during interpretation .
3. Following are the recommendations as per the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)-: guidelines for serum free
light chain analysis & interpretation in multiple myeloma and related disorders-

* Use of free light chain ratio (rFLC) in combination of serum protein electrophoresis & immunofixation for diagnosis

* Use of involved free light chain (iFLC) quantitation or the difference between the involved & uninvolved serum light chains (dFLC)
for serial measurements during monitoring & to define complete response. During monitoring the ratio (rFLC) can be unreliable due
to associated fluctuations in the concentration of uninvolved light chains and renal failure.
