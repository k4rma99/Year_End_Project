Immunophenotyping analysis (6 color leukemia panel)

Expression of CD markers were determined on 26 % of CD45 bright population

CD3 59.7%
CD4 31.5%
CD5 66.3%
CD7 79.6%
CD10 1.5%
CD11b 37.5%
CD13 0.4%
CD19 16.3%
CD20 15.8%
CD33 1.3%
CD34, 0.1%
CD117 0.1%
CD56 20.9%
cCD79a 19.2%
MPO 2.4%
HLADR 20.8%

Descriptive summary: 26% of CD45 bright population (lymphocytes) were gated expressing T, B and NK cells.

Impression: Non - diagnostic. Kindly correlate with morphology and clinical parameters.

Correlation with clinical, cytogenetic and molecular parameters advised.

Reference: WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, revised 4th edition, 2017.

Note: Flow cytometric analysis assist in clinical diagnosis and disease monitoring. The report has to be correlated with clinical and
morphological parameters. The limitations of this result include quality of the specimen and limits of sensitivity.
