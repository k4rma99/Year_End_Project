FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT

Flow cytometric analysis shows a cell cluster with low SSC and moderate CD45 expression. The gated B-Lymphoid
cells (68.0% of all events) show the following expression pattern:

Moderate expression of ICD200, CD45, CD19, CD23, HLADR
Heterogeneous expression of CD20 :

And rest of the markers are negative.
CD19 gated cells are 2.5% positive for CD38 and 12.4% positive for ZAP-70.

Impression

The scatter parameters and antigen expression profile as studied by flow cytometry of the sample are suggestive of
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, B-CLL .

Correlation with clinical, cytogenetic and other hematological parameters is advised.
Comment :- Recommendations for further testing are as follows:

Advised CLL prognostic panel by FISH, IgVH Somatic Hypermutation assay by PCR and sangers sequencing
for further prognostication .
