MRI ABDOMEN

Clinical information: Mild renal failure.

Technique: T2 HASTE axial coronal, T2 TSE axial, coronal, inphase, opposed phase, T2 FS axial, DW with ADC, T1 axial VIBE with post contrast study performed.

Findings:

Liver shows normal size.
No evidence of volume redistribution.
Caudate lobe is mild prominent.
Signal fat fraction is 2.5 %. 3.1 x 2.6 cm 72 mild hyperintense lesion with mild diffusion restriction and central scar noted segment 6 / 7 with heterogeneous enhancement in arterial phase, washout in venous phase with capsular enhancement.
The lesion is abutting the posterior segmental branch of right portal vein.
Tiny cyst noted adjacent to the IVC.
There is no intra or extra hepatic biliary dilatation.
Hepatic vasculature is normal.
Small pericholedochal nodes noted.

Gall bladder show minimal distension with nonspecific wall thickening.
No gall stones.

Spleen bulky.

Pancreas is normal in morphology and signal intensity.
Main pancreatic duct is normal in caliber.

Both adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Right kidney measures 9.0 cm and left kidney measures 7.0 cm.
Tiny cortical cysts noted both sides, one of the cyst in the left kidney mid pole shows T1 hyperintense content.
(Ultrasound correlation show increase in cortical echotexture with accentuated cortico medullary differentiation).

GE junction shows widening.

Aorta show atherosclerotic changes.

No paraaortic or significant pelvic adenopathy.

Small hemangioma noted D12 and L3 vertebra.
No focal enhancing marrow lesion noted.
Few hyperintense areas noted in the left lateral aspect of rib with diffusion restriction.

Marrow shows normal signal.

IMPRESSION:

Approximately 3.1 x 2.6.cm lesion with central scar segment 6 / 7 with heterogeneous enhancement in arterial phase, washout in venous phase with capsular enhancement.
The lesion is abutting the posterior segmental branch of right portal vein.

No portal vein thrombosis.

Normal sized liver with prominent caudate lobe. No left lobe hypertrophy.

Bulky spleen.

No free fluid.

Hiatus hernia.

No significant paraaortic or pelvic lymphadenopathy.

MRI features highly suggest malignant lesion like hepatocellular carcinoma.
Suggest correlation with AFP.
FNAC for confirmation.
