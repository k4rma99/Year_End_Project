ULTRASOUND ABDOMEN & PELVIS
(Trans abdominal study - B mode and colour doppler imaging done using 3-SMHz transducer and ACUSON S2000 Ultrasound system)

Liver : Normal in size (12cm) with mildly increased echotexture.
A round well-defined hypoechoic lesion measuring approximately 27 x 26 mm noted in right lobe.
No evidence of intrahepatic biliary radicles dilatation.

CBD : Normal

PV : Normal

Gallbladder : Partially distended.
No evident calculus noted.
GB wall is within normal limits.

Spleen : Is normal in size (8cm), shape and echotexture.
No evident focal lesion.

Pancreas : Head and body of pancreas appear normal sonographically.

Kidneys : Bilateral renal cortical echoes mildly raised(L>R).
CMD maintained.
No evidence of hydronephrosis seen.
Right kidney measures 10 x 4.3 cm.
A small cortical cyst measuring 8 x 7 mm noted in mid pole.
Left kidney appears smaller in size and measures 7.2 x 3.6 cm.
A calculus measuring 3 mm noted in lower pole.
A cortical cyst measuring 10 x 10 mm noted in mid pole.

Urinary bladder : Minimally distended.
Prevoid volume-70cc.
Post void residual urine volume-20cc (insignificant).

Prostate : Mildly enlarged in size.
Measures 2.8 x 3.8 x 4.9 cm and has an approximate volume of 28cc.

No free fluid is noted in abdomen and pelvis.
No evidence of para-aortic lymphadenopathy noted.
No evidence of pleural effusion is noted.

OPINION:-
Smaller left kidney with bilateral raised renal cortical echoes (L>R)- Renal parenchymal disease to be considered. Suggested correlation with serum-creatinine.
Left renal calculus.
Small bilateral renal simple cortical cysts.
Mild Prostatomegaly.
Grade I fatty change liver. Well-defined hypoechoic lesion in right lobe of liver as described. Suggested CECT abdomen for further evaluation.
