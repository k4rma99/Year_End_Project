CT - WHOLE ABDOMEN (CONTRAST)

STUDY PROTOCOL:
Axial 5 mm cuts were obtained from the diaphragm down to the symphysis, and these were repeated during the dynamic intravenous administration of 60 cc Iohexol 350.

FINDINGS:

The liver is normal sized, with smooth borders and normal attenuation values. No focal abnormalities are seen.
There is no intra or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater appear normal sized.

The gall bladder is normal sized and smooth walled.
No radiodense calculus is seen in it.
There is no pericholecystic fluid.

The pancreas presents normal size and smooth borders.
The parenchyma shows normal internal structure and attenuation values with no hypo or hyperdense intra-pancreatic changes.
No significant ductal dilatation or calcification is seen.
Peripancreatic fat planes are preserved.
The portal vein and superior mesenteric vessels appear normal with no suggestion of filling defect within.
The spleen is of normal size. It has smooth outer contour and a homogeneous internal structure.

There is dilatation of the distal thoracic and proximal abdominal aorta measuring 4.5 cm in caliber for a length of 4 cm.
Rest of the aorta is normal.

The diaphragmatic crurae are normal with no obvious evidence of diaphragmatic defects.
The gastro-oesophageal junction is normal.
The stomach and intestines show normal configuration.
No bowel wall thickening or dilatation is seen.
Mesenteric fat appears normal.

Both adrenal glands are normal sized and show normal configuration and density of their limbs.
Both kidneys appear normal in size and position, with normal width and density of renal parenchyma.

The calyces are of normal shape. The renal pelvis is normal and free of stones, and there is no obstruction of urinary drainage.
Contrast - enhanced scans show normal cortical enhancement and symmetrical contrast excretion into the renal pelves with no filling defects.
The ureters are not dilated.
The perirenal and pararenal spaces are unremarkable.

No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.
There is no free or loculated peritoneal fluid collection.

The pelvic inlet appears normal, with normal configuration of the iliac wings and iliopsoas muscles.
The bladder shows smooth outer contours and normal wall thickness.
No intravesical mass or calculus is seen.

The prostate is normal.

The rectal and pararectal tissue planes are normal.
No abnormality of the vertebral column or the bony pelvis is seen.

The screened lung shows patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:
ANEURYSMAL DILATION OF DISTAL THORACIC AND PROXIMAL ABDOMINAL AORTA. NO THROMBUS WITHIN.
NO EVIDENCE OF PHAECHROMOCYTOMA OR OTHER SPACE OCCUPYING LESIONS IN THE ABDOMEN.
CONSOLIDATION OF THE RIGHT BASAL LUNG.

Please correlate clinically.
